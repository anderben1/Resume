  <h1> Where I'm From </h1>
  <p>I hail from the great state of Michigan, though I moved to Minnesota, where I live today, when I was just 9 years old. I love it in Minneapolis and couldn't imagine living anywhere else. That is until it's January and 50 below zero and then I pretty much want to move to Hawaii and never look back.
  <br>
  <br>
  I love it in Minneapolis because it's just big enough to keep me constantly entertained, but still small enough that I don't get lost or overwhelmed here.</p>
